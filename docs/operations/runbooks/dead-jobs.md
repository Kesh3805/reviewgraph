# Dead jobs present

Alert: `rg-dead-jobs` (severity page). Dashboard: `rg-queue-depth` (see `infra/openobserve/dashboards`).

## Symptom

Dead jobs present. Condition: queue_depth{state="dead"} > 0 for 0m.

## Impact

Reviews may be delayed, degraded or skipped until resolved.

## Likely causes

- Recent deploy or configuration change.
- Dependency saturation or outage (PostgreSQL, Qdrant, model provider, GitHub).
- Unusual traffic volume.

## Diagnosis

- Open the `rg-queue-depth` dashboard and compare against the last 24 h.
- Inspect a slow or failing trace by `span_name` in the traces stream.
- Local: `docker compose logs <service>` for the affected service.
- Check `queue_depth` for the breakdown by closed-enum labels.

## Mitigation

Address the cause found above; roll back the last change if the alert began after a deploy. Pause the alert in OpenObserve only for planned maintenance.

## Escalation

Page the on-call engineer if unresolved after 30 minutes (immediately for page severity).
